    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
      My website will be about fitness information, including different workouts
      and supplements I find to be helpful
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of my website will be to provide useful information to
      people who may not have access or want to add to their current knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
      My target audience will be people beginning in the gym or people who have
      been going for a long time and want more information
    </p>
    <p>
      My page will have a section for workout information, a section for
      supplement information, and within each of those will have different
      article type pages to provide a in depth summary of what each of these
      things does
